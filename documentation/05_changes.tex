    \section{Changes in the initial Idea}
    \begin{flushleft}
        The realization of the idea isn't the same that has been defined beforehand (see chapter \ref{Ideas}). 
        Most of the changes have to do with the idea to define the color by one leaf. This have been the 
        most difficult task and couldn't achive. There was only one solution we came up with. In the middle
        of the bloosom there has to be a cone or a cylinder that acts like a digitalReader and if a specific
        leaf is connected to this object, the lamps has to change its color. However, this would have 
        reduced the amount of space for the light, so we had to find an other idea. The solution was to use
        two leaves that has to be connected to each other. This leads to a shrinking amount of 
        colors that can be shown; however, this would keep the design of the inital idea. That's 
        another reason for this decision.\\

        This also leads to the change of colors. In this change, we initally thought that a specific pair 
        would define a specific color. However, in th programming and building process we changed it 
        and programmed that the amount of connections will change the color and not the a specific pair
        of leaves.
