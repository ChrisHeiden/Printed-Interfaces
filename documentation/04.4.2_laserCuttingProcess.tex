    \subsubsection{Laser Cutting Process}
    \begin{flushleft}
        \noindent
        After milling the base, some experiments with a laser cutter was done. The distance between the
        cuts are essential for the flexibility. To laser cut everything, Illustrator\cite{illustrator} was used
        and a laser cutter. With Illustrator designs shape can be created and can be uploaded on the cutter. \\~\\

        \noindent
        At first, acrylic glass has been cut because it is transparent and it would help to light up 
        a larger space; however, after a fail, wood was the second best choice. See the whole cutting process 
        in Figure \ref{fig:laserCutTests}
