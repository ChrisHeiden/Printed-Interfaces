    \section{Conclusion}
    \begin{flushleft}
        The class Printed Interfaces helped everyone to get to know the basics in programming,
        electrical engineering and presenting ideas. This will help in future projects, and it gives 
        anyone a good set of basic knowledge, so students could autodidactically learn other 
        topics in this field.\\~\\

        To summarize the project, the project turned out well. The problem with the laser 
        cutting pattern became bigger than expected, so more time had to be invested in the 
        flexible feature. Still, in the end, cork had to be used instead. Sure, wood couldn't 
        be used because of flexibility problems but still, every functionality could be 
        integrated, so in the end, the prototype could show every function.
