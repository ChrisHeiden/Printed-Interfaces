        The class Printed Interfaces helped everyone to get to know the basics in programming,
        electrtechnic, presenting ideas. This will help in future projects, and it gives anyone 
        a good set of basic knowledge, so we could learn autodidactic other topics in this field.\\~\\

        To summerize the project, we would say that it turned out well. The problem with the laser 
        cutting pattern became bigger than we tought, so we had to spend much time on this. Still, 
        in the end, we had to use cork instead. Sure, we couldn't achive to use wood but every 
        functionality could be presented, so in the end, the prototype could show every function we 
        wanted to integrate in the product.
