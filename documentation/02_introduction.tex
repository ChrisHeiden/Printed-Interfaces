    \section{Introduction}
    \begin{flushleft}
        In class "Printed Interfaces", we learn the basics in electronics and how a circuit works. We 
        use this knowledge to create products that use so-called microcontrollers to add smart features.
        However, these products can work without common wiring. There are other options we can use to 
        conductivity like conductive ink, conductive rubber or other material that can close a circuit. 
        Therefore, students get introduced to programming conductive material and how to use them
        and electronics.
