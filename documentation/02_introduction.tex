    \section{Introduction}
    \begin{flushleft}
        In class Printed Interfaces, students learned the basics in electronics and how circuits work. 
        They used this knowledge to create products that use so-called microcontrollers to add smart features.
        These products can work without common wiring. There are other options people can use to 
        create circuits like conductive ink, conductive rubber or other material. 
        Therefore, students get introduced to programming, conductive material and how to use them
        and electronics in this class.
