    \section{Introduction}
    \begin{flushleft}
        In class Printed Interfaces, students learned the basics in electronics and how 
        circuits work. They used this knowledge to create products that use so-called 
        microcontrollers to add smart features.
        These products and their circuit can work without wires. Instead, people can 
        use to conductive ink, conductive rubber or other material that is conductive. 
        So, students get introduced to programming, conductive material and how 
        to use them in this class.
