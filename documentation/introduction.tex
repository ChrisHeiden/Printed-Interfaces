    \begin{flushleft}
        In a class called "Printed Interfaces", we try to create circuits that does not use common wires 
        to link sensors and microcontrollers. Therefore, we use conductive ink, conductive rubber or other
        material that can close a circuit, for example. Therefore, students get intoduced to physical 
        computing and electronics. Moreover, they learn how to program these electronics.
