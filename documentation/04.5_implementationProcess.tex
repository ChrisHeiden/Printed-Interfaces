    \subsection{Soldering and Implementation Process}
    \begin{flushleft}
        After getting to know the material, soldering and programming were the next steps(see Figure \ref{fig:solderingProcess} and \ref{fig:UMLDiagram}).
        An Arduino Pro Mini \cite{arduinoProMini}, some resistors (like 
        1M\si{\ohm} resistors), copper foil and a Neopixel WS2812 has been used. \\

        To program every functionality, the Arduino IDE  has been used. The programming language 
        is C++ with some additional Arduino specific function and global variables \cite{introductionArduino}. 
        Different classes has been programmed that specify different functionalities or sensor \cite{
        arduinoClasses}. The following UML diagram shows the final code structure of the project (see 
        Figure \ref{fig:UMLDiagram}).

        \noindent
        The resistors and the copper foil are used to build a capacitive sensor. \cite{Badger2019} 
        If the user pushes the capacitive sensor, the microcontroller can sense it. This functionality
        will be used to create an analog slider. The slider has been programmed, so users can change the 
        brightness. However, just three capacitive sensors have been programmed because of the Arduino 
        Pro Mini doesn't have enough digital pins for every sensor. However, three capacitive sensors can show 
        the concept and the initial idea. The soldering process of capacitive sensors can be found in 
        Figure \ref{fig:finalSoldering}. \\~\\

        \noindent
        The Neopixel WS2812 will be used to make the lamp shine in different colors. \cite{Burgess2019} 
        To get close to the initial idea, three more holes have been drilled inside the base. 
        This is the place for every LED (Neopixel WS2812). Before putting them inside, cables had to be 
        soldered, so the LEDs could be tested(see \ref{fig:solderingProcess_1}).\\~\\

        \noindent
        Furthermore, the leaf connections have been implemented, so the system can detect if 
        the users pull a blossom. This process changes the color of the lamp.

        \noindent
        The final code can be found on GitHub. %TODO: Add right webpage
