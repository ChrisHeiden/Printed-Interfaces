    \subsection{Detailed Explanation of the Blossom Shaped Lamp Idea}
        \begin{flushleft}
            In the end, the decision was made to develop the third idea (see chapter \ref{BlossomShapedLamp}). 
            That's why a more detailed explanation of this idea should be presented. \\~\\

            The lamp consists of two parts. First, there is be the base that is out of 
            wood. Inside of this base, there are a microcontroller, wires, a battery. On top 
            of the and base, there are LEDs and copper foil. All together regulate the whole 
            system. Therefore, many wholes and wire paths are drilled.\\

            The second main part is the blossom that is on top of the base. A special pattern 
            is used, so the wood becomes flexible. This flexibility is used to get a 
            connection to each leaf. Every leaf defines a specific color, so if one isn't 
            connected anymore, the color of the light change. \\

            Around the blossom, several capacitive sensors can detect if one of them is touched. 
            By touching two or more capacitive sensors during a short time, the user can 
            define the brightness. By a clockwise interaction, the brightness becomes higher and 
            by a counterclockwise interaction, the brightness gets lower. \\
