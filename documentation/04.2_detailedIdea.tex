    \subsection{Detailed Explaination of the Idea}
        \begin{flushleft}
            In the end, we decided to develop the third idea (see chapter \ref{BlossomShapedLamp}). That's why we want to explain 
            how it should work in detail. \newline
            The base of the prototype will be milled, so we get a perfect shape. Therefore, we will use Autodesk Fusion 360\cite{autodeskFusion360}
            to model it. In the center of the base will be the blossom shaped lamp that can be opened. Around this, we want to have a 
            circled shaped groud. There we want to place copper foil that is linked with a microcontroller, % add explaination
            so the foil can be used as a slider. This interaction will change the brightness of the lamp. \newline
            However, the major functionality is the lamp itself. Therefore, we want to laser cut the shape, so the users of the lamp can
            take one or several blossoms to open it. This will change the color shining of the lamp. We want to use a transparent acrylic glass.
            Therefore, we have to cut holes inside the glass, so the shape can change.  \newline
            If all blossoms are connected, then the lamp doesn't shine at all. However, if the user opens the blossom, then the lamp gets on
            and the color change. 
            \newline
            \newline
            To develop such a device, we want to use an Arduino Pro Mini, copper foil and programmable WS2812B LEDs.
            Furthermore, we want to use a CNC machine and cutters to build the case.
