    \subsection{Detailed Explanation of the Blossom Shaped Lamp Idea}
        \begin{flushleft}
            In the end, a decision was made to develop the third idea (see chapter \ref{BlossomShapedLamp}). 
            That's why a more detailed explanation of this idea should be presented. \\~\\

            The lamp will consist of two parts. First, there will be the base that will be out of 
            wood. Inside of this base, there will be a microcontroller, wires, a battery, LEDs, and
            copper foil that together regulate the whole system. Therefore, many wholes and wire 
            paths will be drilled. The base of the prototype will be milled. To model the base 
            Autodesk Fusion 360\cite{autodeskFusion360} will be used.\\

            The second main part will be the blossom that will be on top of the base. This blossom
            will be laser cut out of wood. A special pattern will be used, so the wood becomes flexible.
            This flexibility will be used to get a connection to each leaf. Every leaf defines a 
            specific color, so if one isn't connected anymore, the color of the light will change. \\

            Around the blossom, there will be several capacitive sensors that can detect if one of them 
            is touched. By touching two or more capacitive sensors during a short time, the user can 
            define the brightness. By a clockwise interaction, the brightness becomes higher and 
            by a counterclockwise interaction, the brightness gets lower. \\
