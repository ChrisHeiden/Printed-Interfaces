    \subsection{Soldering and Implementation Process}
    \begin{flushleft}
        After getting to know the material and how everything can be cut, we had to 
        solder everything together. Therefore, we used an Arduino Pro Mini \cite{arduinoProMini} 
        as a microcontroller, some resistors (like 10k\si{\ohm} resistors), copper foil and a Neopixel WS2812. \newline
        The resistors and the copper foil are used to build a capacitive sensor. \cite{Badger2019} 
        This means, they can detect finger touching and it will be used to create an analog slider.
        The Neopixel WS2812 will be used to make the lamp shine in different colors. \cite{Burgess2019} 
        \newline 
        \noindent

        The theoretical idea and the material are defined, so we can program everything. Therefore,
        we used the Arduino IDE and programmed everything in C++ with some additional Arduino spacific 
        function and global variables \cite{introductionArduino}. To Implement everything, we programmed
        different classes that specifies different functionalities or sensor \cite{arduinoClasses}. The 
        following UML diagram shows the final code structure of the project (see Figure \ref{fig:UMLDiagram}).

            \label{fig:UMLDiagram}
        \end{figure}

        
        \noindent
        To become close to the initial idea, we drilled three more whole inside the base and 
        pulled the Neopixel WS2812 inside. Sure, before we soldered cables on them, so we can 
        test them before soldering everything together. After testing the Pixels, we soldered 
        them on the microcontroller (see \ref{fig:solderingProcess}). In addition, we programmed
        the slider, so users can change the brightness. However, we just programmed three capacitive
        sensors because the Arduino Pro Mini dones't have more digital pins. Still, three capacitive
        sensors can show the concept and the initial idea. Furthermore, we implemented the code for
        the leave connections, so the system can detect if the users pull a blossom. This process 
        change the color of the lamp.

    To program these functionalities, we programmed an Arduino program that can deal with these inputs 
    and outputs. The final code can be found on GitHub. %TODO: Add right webpage
